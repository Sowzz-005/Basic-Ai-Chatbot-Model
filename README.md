# Basic-Ai-Chatbot-Model
This project is a lightweight AI chat interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that connects directly to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model using the generateContent REST API. Users can type a text prompt, optionally attach an image from their device, and receive an AI-generated response displayed in a chat-style layout
